        -Captures are mandatory,when a man is found adjacent to an opposing piece behind which is an empty position, the player must attain this empty position and remove the opposing man from the board.<br>
        -Should a player be able to capture either with a man or a king, he must do so with the king.<br>
        -If multiple captures are possible, the player may choose between capturing one piece or the entire line; the capture of a partial line is not permitted. If multiple captures are performed<br>
        -Players cannot capture their own pieces<br>
        <span class="sub_title">End game</span><br>
        -A player with no valid move remaining loses. This occurs if the player has no pieces left, or if all the player's pieces are obstructed from moving by opponent pieces<br>
        -The game is considered a draw when the same position repeats itself for the third time (not necessarily consecutive)<br>
        -If, during 25 moves, there were only king movements, without piece movements or jumps, the game is considered a draw<br>
