        <li>Men move one square diagonally forward</li>
        <li>
          King move diagonally forward or backward any number of positions

      <span class="sub_title">Capture</span><br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Should a player be able to capture either with a man or a king, he
          must do so with the king.
        </li>
        <li>
          multiple captures are possible, the player may choose between
          capturing one piece or the entire line; the capture of a partial line
          is not permitted. If multiple captures are performed
        </li>
        <li>cannot capture their own pieces</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="sub_title">End game</span><br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          player with no valid move remaining loses. This occurs if the player
          has no pieces left, or if all the player's pieces are obstructed from
          moving by opponent pieces
        </li>
        <li>
          The game is considered a draw when the same position repeats itself
          for the third time (not necessarily consecutive)
        </li>
        <li>
          If, during 25 moves, there were only king movements, without piece
          movements or jumps, the game is considered a draw
        </li>
      </ul>
